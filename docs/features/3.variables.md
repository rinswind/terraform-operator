# Variables
Variables can be specified in the `spec.variables` section. There are two ways to how variables are used:
1. Variable needed by your Terraform module
2. Environment Variables (possibly needed for your Terraform provider)

## Variables for Terraform Modules
These variables are needed by your module, they can be specified as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: run.terraform-operator.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
...
spec:
  ...
  variables:
    - key: the_name_of_the_variable
      value: value_of_the_variable

      # valueFrom:
      #   secretKeyRef:
      #     name: aws-credentials
      #     key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY

      #    configMapKeyRef
      #      name: common-cfg
      #      key: some-key
```

You can specify the value directly in the `value` field. Variables can also be pulled from a [secretkeyRef](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-environment-variables) or [configMapKeyRef](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#define-container-environment-variables-using-configmap-data), this can be done by specifying the `valueFrom` field 

## Variables as Environment Variables
Yon can specify variables to be set as environment variables, these variables will not be used in your terraform module, but maybe needed by the Terraform provider. Lets take the [AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#environment-variables) as an example. 

The provider expects certain variables to be set to authenticate. You can specify environment variables by flagging the `environmentVariable` as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: run.terraform-operator.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
...
spec:
  ...
  variables:
    - key: the_name_of_the_variable
      environmentVariable: true
      value: value_of_the_variable

      # valueFrom:
      #   secretKeyRef:
      #     name: aws-credentials
      #     key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY

      #    configMapKeyRef
      #      name: common-cfg
      #      key: some-key
```
