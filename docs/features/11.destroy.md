# Terraform Destroy
You can run a destroy on your Terraform module by flagging the `spec.destroy` field

```yaml
apiVersion: run.terraform-operator.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
...
spec:
  ...
  destroy: true

  # deleteCompletedJobs: false
```

By default, completed jobs will not be deleted, you can alter the behavior and delete the completed jobs by setting `spec.deleteCompletedJobs` to `true`
